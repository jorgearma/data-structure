# Data Structures Repository

This repository contains implementations of various data structures in different programming languages such as JavaScript, Java, and Python. Our goal is to provide clear and efficient implementations that can be used as references or bases for other projects.

## Purpose

This repository was created to practice and have handy implementations of fundamental data structures. Additionally, it demonstrates my ability to write and maintain quality code, which is crucial in any technology area, including cybersecurity 

## Implemented Data Structures

### JavaScript
- **listaenlazada.js**: Implementation of a linked list.
- **queue.js**: Implementation of a queue.
- **stack.js**: Implementation of a stack.

### Coming Soon
We plan to add implementations in other languages such as Java and Python. Here are some of the data structures we plan to add:

#### Java
- Linked List
- Queue
- Stack

#### Python
- Linked List
- Queue
- Stack

## Installation

To use these implementations, simply clone the repository and use the files as needed. Below is how to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/data-structures.git
